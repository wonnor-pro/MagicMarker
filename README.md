# MagicMarker

I like to **mark** paragraphs when reading long texts, which helps me concentrate. Hence, I need a magic marker for my chrome browser. :))

Hopefully one day it could auto-generate a markdown notes for me.

- Able to highlight text [✓]
- Able to capture highlighted text to the local storage [✓]
- Able to output highlighted text in markdown file [ ]
