# MagicMarker

I like to **mark** paragraphs when reading long texts, which helps me concentrate. Hence, I need a magic marker for my chrome browser. :))

Hopefully one day it could auto-generate a markdown notes for me.

**MVP Plan**

- Chrome Extension basic project setup [$\checkmark$]
- Able to highlight text [ ]
- Able to capture highlighted text to the local storage [ ]
- Able to output highlighted text in markdown file [ ]
- Able to summarise and auto-generate key words for the notes [ ]
